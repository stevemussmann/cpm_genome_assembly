# 10: Post-annotation Analysis

`revcomList.pl` is used to selectively reverse complement chromosomes in the Colorado Pikeminnow genome to allow comparison with Spikedace and Loach Minnow in SyRI

`mefuList.txt` and `ticoList.txt` contain the lists of Colorado Pikeminnow chromosomes that need to be reverse complemented for comparison to Spikedace and Loach Minnow, respectively.

`getLongestTranscript.pl` is used to extract the longest transcript of each gene from the funannotate protein fasta output before running orthofinder.
