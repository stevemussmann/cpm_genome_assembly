#09: RNA Alignment

This directory contains two scripts beginning with '01_' because a de novo transcriptome assembly was performed (Trinity) and a reference-aligned assembly was also performed (hisat & stringtie).

The de novo assembly was used in the annotation, following recommendations of [this tutorial](https://gist.github.com/darencard/bb1001ac1532dd4225b030cf0cd61ce2).
