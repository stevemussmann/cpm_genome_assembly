# Colorado Pikeminnow Genome Assembly
Scripts used for assembly of the Colorado Pikeminnow (*Ptychocheilus lucius*) genome.

## Description
These scripts were utilized for the genome assembly and subsequent analyses described in the following publication:

Steven M Mussmann, Assembly and annotation of a chromosome-level reference genome for the endangered Colorado pikeminnow (*Ptychocheilus lucius*), G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics, Volume 14, Issue 11, November 2024, jkae217, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae217

Upon manuscript acceptance, the raw RNA and DNA sequence data used for genome assembly and annotation will become available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA1003539. The assembled genome will become available under GenBank accession JAVCAX000000000, and the associated genome annotation will be provided on the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/W9ZUY). 

## Documentation
Folders in this repository are numbered with prefixes indicating order of operations. Scripts within folders also follow this naming convention to indicate order of operations. 

Occasional exceptions to these naming conventions occur when a script or other provided input file is called by a numbered script. Rarely, an analysis was unable to be scripted (e.g., eggNOG server submission). These exceptions are documented using README.md files which appear in the relevant subfolders of this repository.

The `unused_scripts` folder contains code that was used during exploratory analyses. None of the code in this folder or its subfolders was utilized in the finalized analyses described in the above manuscript. However, these scripts were retained here if needed for future reference by the author.
